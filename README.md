# Hi, I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹

## Full-Stack Developer | Theatre Tech | Union Dispatch Software Engineer

I didn't set out to build a production dispatch system. I was working full-time as a dispatcher and just kept solving the problems that annoyed me. Sixteen months later, I'm managing 3,864+ crew members across hundreds of shows, sending hundreds of SMS messages dailyâ€”while still dispatching. No roadmap, no planâ€”just one brick on top of another until it became something real.

## Featured Project: The Board

**Production-grade crew dispatch system** managing theatre crew scheduling, SMS communication, and worker assignments for union locals. Built while working full-time as a union dispatcherâ€”literally automating my own job while doing it.

### Production Stats
- **3,864 workers** actively managed
- **Hundreds of shows** dispatched in production
- **Hundreds of SMS daily** (17,668+ total and counting)
- **84,544+ database records** (after learning backups the hard way)
- **141 REST API endpoints** with 100% authentication coverage
- **Real-time WebSocket updates** for live coordination

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:   Next.js 15 â€¢ React 19 â€¢ TypeScript â€¢ Tailwind CSS â€¢ DaisyUI
Backend:    Next.js API Routes â€¢ Service Layer Pattern â€¢ WebSocket
Database:   SQLite (Better-SQLite3) â€¢ 49 tables â€¢ 56 migrations
Auth:       NextAuth.js â€¢ Session-based â€¢ Rate limiting
SMS:        Multi-provider (Twilio/YakChat/TextMagic)
Testing:    Jest â€¢ Playwright â€¢ Integration tests
```

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Dispatch**: Seniority-based automatic assignment with conflict detection
- **SMS Integration**: Pattern-based response parsing, batch processing, real-time monitoring
- **Union Policy Engine**: Configurable strategies for different union scenarios
- **Advanced Analytics**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and performance metrics
- **Security First**: 100% API protection, rate limiting, failed login tracking

## Current Projects

### [crew-caller](https://github.com/Vkeats/crew-caller) - Production System
**Status**: Active Production | **Created**: June 2024

The current production dispatch system serving union locals. Handles all real-world crew scheduling, SMS communication, and assignment management.

**Highlights**:
- 96 React components with specialized "app" components
- 66 library modules with 462 exports
- Comprehensive documentation system
- PM2/Docker deployment ready

### [the-board](https://github.com/Vkeats/the-board) - Next Generation
**Status**: In Active Development | **Created**: October 2024

Next-generation platform with cloud-native architecture and enhanced features.

**Planned Improvements**:
- PostgreSQL for production-scale concurrent access
- AI-powered SMS response parsing (vs regex)
- Mobile app for workers
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Enhanced real-time collaboration features

## Development Journey

### From Zero to Production in 16 Months

```
Phase 1: Learning Fundamentals (Dec 2023 - Jun 2024)
â”œâ”€ learning: Basic programming concepts
â””â”€ Dungeon-Crawler-Project: First complete project

Phase 2: Early Prototypes (Mar 2024)
â”œâ”€ Appv2: Early web stack exploration
â”œâ”€ Staff-Manager: First crew management system
â””â”€ Union-Local: Union workflow exploration

Phase 3: Feature Development (Feb - Mar 2024)
â”œâ”€ Algorithm: Intelligent worker assignment algorithms
â””â”€ iatse-dispatch: First dispatch system with SMS

Phase 4: Integration & Consolidation (Jun - Jul 2024)
â”œâ”€ UnionManager: Comprehensive platform integration
â””â”€ CallSteward-CSV-Wizard: Legacy data migration tools

Phase 5: Production (Jun 2024 - Present)
â””â”€ crew-caller: Production-ready system with 84k+ records

Phase 6: Next Generation (Oct 2024 - Future)
â””â”€ the-board: Cloud-native PostgreSQL platform
```

**What Actually Happened**:
- Each repository solved an immediate problem, not a planned phase
- Production users taught me what actually mattered (not documentation)
- I discovered patterns by building, not by designing upfront
- Tests came when things broke enough times to hurt
- The "architecture" emerged from solving real problems

## Philosophy

> "Build it. Break it. Fix it. Ship it."

That's it. That's the whole process:
- **Build** the dumbest thing that could possibly work
- **Break** it with actual users and real data
- **Fix** it when it hurts enough to matter
- **Ship** it before it's "ready"
- **Repeat** until it stops breaking

No big rewrites. No perfect architecture. Just: solve the problem in front of you, let production teach you what actually matters, and ship when it works well enough.

## On Documentation

I document things when I get confused by my own code. That's it.

When I come back to code after a month and think "what the hell was I doing here?"â€”that's when I write docs. Not before, not as best practice, but when the pain of not having docs exceeds the pain of writing them.

Turns out, documenting when you're actually confused produces better docs than documenting when you think you should. The crew-caller project has thousands of lines of docs because I kept getting lost in my own code.
