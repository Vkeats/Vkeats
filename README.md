# Hi, I'm Vincent ðŸ‘‹

**Full-Stack Developer | Theatre Tech | Production Software Engineer**

Vincent built a production-grade crew dispatch system in 16 months while working full-time as a dispatcher. Started with CS50 and 100 Devs. Graduated to managing 3,000+ crew members across hundreds of shows with real-time SMS coordination.

## Featured Project: The Board

A production-ready crew dispatch platform for theatre unions featuring intelligent scheduling and SMS coordination.

**Production-Proven at Scale:**
- Manages 3,000+ crew members simultaneously with real-time availability tracking
- Processes hundreds of daily SMS messages across multiple providers
- Battle-tested over 16 months dispatching hundreds of live shows
- Enterprise-grade architecture: 49-table database schema, 143 authenticated API endpoints
- Real-time coordination via WebSocket for instant crew updates

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Service Layer Pattern, WebSocket
- **Database**: SQLite with Better-SQLite3, 49 tables, comprehensive migrations
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with session management and rate limiting
- **SMS**: Multi-provider support (Twilio, YakChat, TextMagic)
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, integration tests
- **DevOps**: PM2, Docker, Railway deployment

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent, seniority-based worker assignment with conflict detection
- Pattern-based SMS response parsing with batch processing
- Configurable union policy engine
- Advanced analytics with structured logging
- Comprehensive API security and rate limiting

## Development Journey

**From CS50 to Production in 16 Months**

Vincent started with Harvard's CS50 (December 2023) and Leon Noel's 100 Devs bootcamp. By June 2024, he had deployed a production dispatch system managing real theatre crews - built while working full-time as a dispatcher.

**The Learning Path:**
- **December 2023**: Started CS50 (Harvard's intro to computer science)
- **Early 2024**: Completed 100 Devs web development bootcamp (Leon Noel)
- **Learning Projects**: Built Dungeon-Crawler game to practice fundamentals
- **The Pivot**: Recognized manual crew dispatching at work as a solvable problem
- **Applied Learning**: Used bootcamp knowledge (React, Node.js, databases) on real problem
- **June 2024**: Deployed first production version after 6 months of development
- **June 2024 - Present**: Continuous iteration based on production feedback

**What Made This Work:**
- **Real problem to solve**: Dispatchers needed better tools, not another tutorial project
- **Direct user access**: Daily feedback from people using the system
- **Actual stakes**: Real shows depend on correct crew assignments
- **Learning by necessity**: Production bugs taught more than any course could
- **Documentation habit**: 12,000+ lines written to internalize complex systems

## Technical Growth

**What Building for Production Taught Me:**

**Started knowing** (from CS50 & 100 Devs):
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals
- Basic React and Node.js concepts
- Database basics and SQL
- Git version control

**Learned through production:**
- **Full-stack Architecture**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **Database Design**: 49-table SQLite schema evolved through real requirements
- **API Development**: 143 authenticated endpoints with proper error handling and rate limiting
- **Real-time Systems**: WebSocket coordination for instant crew updates
- **SMS Integration**: Multi-provider system with failover (Twilio, YakChat, TextMagic)
- **Production DevOps**: PM2 process management, Docker deployment, Railway hosting
- **Security Fundamentals**: NextAuth.js, session management, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests, Playwright E2E tests for critical workflows

**The Gap Between Bootcamp and Production:**
- Bootcamps teach syntax and patterns
- Production teaches error handling, edge cases, and user needs
- Real users find bugs tutorials never mention
- Performance matters when dispatchers are waiting for responses
- Documentation is the only way to remember why you built something

## Philosophy

**Start with courses. Learn through production. Ship before you're ready.**

Vincent's path wasn't bootcamp â†’ portfolio â†’ job. It was:
- Learn fundamentals (CS50, 100 Devs)
- Find a real problem (work needed better tools)
- Build something that works (not something perfect)
- Ship to real users (dispatchers, not GitHub)
- Fix what breaks (production is the best teacher)
- Document when confused (12,000+ lines later, systems make sense)

The best way to learn isn't more tutorials - it's having real users who need your code to work.
