## 💡 Philosophy

> "Modern technology should enhance traditional workflows, not replace them. The best software respects the domain expertise of its users while automating the tedious parts."

I believe in:
- **Incremental iteration** over big rewrites
- **Production feedback** over theoretical perfection
- **Documentation** as a force multiplier
- **Testing** as a requirement, not an afterthought
- **User needs** over technical ego

---

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

Every project includes:
- 📖 Comprehensive README with quick start guides
- 🏗️ Architecture documentation explaining design decisions
- 🔧 Development guides for contributor onboarding
- 📊 API reference with examples
- 🧪 Testing documentation and strategies

**Example**: [crew-caller documentation](https://github.com/Vkeats/crew-caller/blob/main/README.md) includes 8 major documentation files covering everything from deployment to development workflows.
